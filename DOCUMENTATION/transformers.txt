Importing necessary libraries:

pandas for data manipulation and preprocessing
torch and torch.nn for building and training the PyTorch model
torch.utils.data for creating the dataset and data loader
transformers for loading the BERT tokenizer and model

Defining the dataset class:

MyDataset inherits from Dataset and is used to represent the preprocessed data.
The __init__ method initializes the dataset with the preprocessed data.
The __len__ method returns the length of the dataset.
The __getitem__ method returns the data at the specified index, converted to a PyTorch tensor.

Defining data preprocessing steps:

The preprocess_data function takes raw data as input and performs the following steps:
Fills missing values with zeros
Converts categorical variables to numerical representations using label encoding
Normalizes numerical features by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation
Combines the processed numerical and categorical features into a single DataFrame
The preprocessed data is returned.

Loading and preprocessing the data:

The CSV files containing stock data, customer data, and transaction data are loaded using pd.read_csv.
The preprocess_data function is applied to each dataset to preprocess the data.
The preprocessed datasets are stored in variables preprocessed_stock_data, preprocessed_customer_data, and preprocessed_transaction_data.

Loading the BERT tokenizer and model:

The BERT tokenizer and model are loaded from the pre-trained 'bert-base-uncased' model using BertTokenizer.from_pretrained and BertModel.from_pretrained.
Example text data is tokenized and encoded using the BERT tokenizer.
BERT embeddings are generated for the encoded text data using the BERT model.

Creating dataset and data loader instances:

MyDataset instances are created for each preprocessed dataset.
DataLoader instances are created for each dataset with a batch size of 32 and shuffling enabled.

Defining the financial advice model:

The FinancialAdviceModel class is defined, which inherits from nn.Module.
The model consists of two fully connected layers with ReLU activation in between.
The input size of the first layer is set to the number of features in the preprocessed stock data, and the output size is set to 1.
The model is instantiated with the specified input size, hidden size, and output size.

Configuring the training setup:

An Adam optimizer is created with a learning rate of 0.001 to optimize the model parameters.
Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss is chosen as the criterion for calculating the loss during training.

Training the model:

The training loop runs for 10 epochs (iterations over the entire dataset).

For each batch in the stock data loader:
The optimizer's gradients are set to zero.
The batch data is checked for any NaN values, and the batch is skipped if any are found.
The batch data is passed through the model to obtain the outputs.
The loss is calculated between the model outputs and the target values (last column of the batch data).
The loss is backpropagated to compute the gradients.
The optimizer updates the model parameters based on the computed gradients.
The loss value for each epoch is printed.

Saving the trained model:
The trained model's state dictionary is saved to a file named 'financial_advice_model.pth' using torch.save.
